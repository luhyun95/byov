      <h2>How to Build a Villa in Bali</h2>
      <p>Building a villa is like building a slightly bigger house. We didn't just want to build an ordinary villa where people just stay for a night and leave; we wanted to create a place where people meet, a place that feels like home even if it's your first time visiting. The process of building a house in Bali is similar to the steps listed below.</p>

      <h3>1. Purchase Land</h3>
      <p>Depending on luck and connections, this can take an average of 3 months to 1 year. This is arguably the most difficult part. I spent the last year searching for land, checking zoning, verifying documents, checking market prices, and negotiating prices. In Bali, you need to check if the landowner is the real owner, verify the owner's family register, check if the licenses are real, and verify if taxes have been paid. In Bali, most of the land deals are made between locals who know each other, and even among those, there are almost no safe lands to invest in once you verify all the documents. After 3 times of almost reaching a deal and then having it fall through, a friend of a friend miraculously introduced us to this land that wasn't registered anywhere. We chose a slightly sloping land that has a view of the beach and rice fields, and is next to a surfing beach and a valley. Our neighbor and friend of a friend, Alex, introduced us to the land.</p>

      <p>Before purchasing the land, we spent 5 weeks on tax and legal reviews, established a local corporation, and legally own the land in Indonesia through the corporation. After receiving the land documents, we had to go through the tedious process of applying for and receiving the land ownership license and building license. If anyone is interested in investing in real estate in Indonesia, I can cover that in a separate post.</p>

      <h3>2. Architectural/Interior Design</h3>
      <p>Currently in progress, this can take an average of 1.5 to 3 months. This is the most enjoyable part of the whole construction process. It's the time when you can visualize your dream and see it take shape. We worked with architects, interior designers, and land surveyors, exchanging photos, sketches, and 3D files to turn the villa of our imagination into a tangible form and develop a feasible plan. We wanted to create a villa where people can do yoga and meditation, and also hold festivals once or twice a year. Incorporating the purpose and direction of the space into the architectural design is a crucial step that can take anywhere from 1.5 to 3 months, depending on the number of revisions. As of October 2023, we have completed the land survey, sent the initial brief (requirements) to the architect, received the first sketch, requested revisions, and are currently waiting for proposals from the interior designer.</p>

      <h3>3. Construction</h3>
      <p>This can take an average of 10-15 months. Before construction begins, you need to prepare the land, which includes building a parking lot, temporary housing for workers, and boundary walls. These costs are usually not included in the construction budget. In most construction sites in Bali, workers come from the neighboring island of Java and stay for a few months to complete the construction. Depending on the situation, you may need to build walls for boundaries, spaces for workers to stay, and parking spaces first.</p>

      <p>If the land is wet, as many lands in Bali are near rice fields or are former rice fields, it needs to be dried first. There are two ways to do this - naturally drying the land for a few months, or filling the land with limestone, which is commonly used in Bali for construction and land preparation.</p>

      <p>MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing Engineering) involves building the basic infrastructure of the building, such as mechanical systems, electrical systems, and plumbing. This is usually done by the architect in collaboration with specialized engineers during the design phase, and later by the construction company on-site.</p>

      <p>After the MEP work is done, the foundation is laid. This involves leveling the ground, installing pillars, and preparing the base for the building. The type of structure and materials used for the foundation can vary depending on the soil condition, height of the building, and proximity to the sea. If the soil is not firm, the ground needs to be dug deeper. The taller the building, the more reinforced structures are needed.</p>

      <p>Once the foundation is laid, the upper floors, walls, and roof are constructed. Most of the "beautiful buildings" we see are completed in the last month of construction. Before that, it's mostly just concrete structures. A project manager should be hired to supervise the construction site daily to prevent delays and poor workmanship. The construction company may also request changes in materials or additional work due to fluctuating market prices, which can significantly affect the budget.</p>

      <h3>4. Preparing for Opening</h3>
      <p>The last month of construction is crucial. In the beginning, there isn't much for the architect or designer to do as the work mainly involves groundwork, sewage, and concrete. The architect usually visits the site every two weeks. The highlight is the last three months when the building starts to take shape. The last month is when the walls, tiles, paint, and lighting are installed, and the owner, architect, and designer need to be on-site regularly to supervise the work. Once all that is done, furniture is brought in, the pool is filled with water, and the place is cleaned up for opening.</p>

      <p>The timeline for construction is as follows, assuming everything goes smoothly. Smaller houses usually take about a year, while larger projects can take 15-24 months. There are many legal details and technical construction processes that we haven't covered. We worked with local partners and law firms to handle all the steps. In developing countries like Indonesia, legal matters can be complicated, and the process for foreign investment is not well-established, so it's crucial to work with local partners and law firms.</p>
